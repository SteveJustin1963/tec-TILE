### Grippers 
There are three types of grippers: those that use suction cups, those that use magnets, and those that use mechanical jaws or fingers. Robot grippers are devices that are attached to the end of a robotic arm and are used to grip and manipulate objects. There are a variety of different types of grippers, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.

One of the most popular types of grippers is the suction cup gripper. This type of gripper uses a vacuum to create a seal around an object, which allows the gripper to pick up and move the object. Suction cup grippers are simple and reliable, but they can only be used on smooth surfaces and are not well suited for picking up small or delicate objects.

Another type of gripper is the pneumatic gripper. This type of gripper uses air pressure to open and close its jaws, which allows it to grip a wide range of objects, including those with irregular shapes. Pneumatic grippers are more versatile than suction cup grippers, but they require a constant supply of compressed air, which can be expensive.

Magnetic grippers are another option for picking up and manipulating objects. Magnetic grippers use magnets to hold onto objects, which makes them ideal for picking up metal objects. However, magnetic grippers can only be used on objects that are ferromagnetic, which means they cannot be used on objects made of aluminum or other non-magnetic materials.

Finally, vacuum grippers are a type of gripper that uses a vacuum to hold onto objects. Vacuum grippers are similar to suction cup grippers, but they have a more sophisticated design that allows them to pick up and move objects with greater precision. Vacuum grippers are more expensive than other types of grippers, but they offer the best performance for picking up and moving delicate objects.

## Amorphous gripper  

From https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Universal-Robot-Gripper/

"They created an amorphous gripper that was able to mold itself to the object ...is much more versatile... make your own DIY universal gripper for your robots. 
...works because of a process that is called "jamming." When a granular material such as coffee is compressed, it becomes very rigid. As the pressure increases so does the amount of friction between the individual grains. This effectively locks the grains in place....as soon as the seal is broken and vacuum is gone, the coffee become soft and pliable and can be poured like a fluid...same with many granular materials such as rice, couscous , sand etc...A balloon is filled coffee grounds and attached to an air hose. When balloon is slightly pressurized the grounds are loose and easily rearranged. By pressing the balloon against an object, the grounds will move around it and take its shape. But when the air is sucked out of the balloon, the grounds are compressed and grip the object. The rubber surface of the balloon also helps to keep a hold of the object."


### Tentacle - soft silcone
Robot silicone tentacle grippers are one of the most versatile and handy tools that a robot can have! These grippers can be used to grab onto and lift objects, as well as to provide a soft and gentle touch.

One of the great things about robot silicone tentacle grippers is that they can be used in a variety of settings and for a variety of tasks. For example, they can be used in manufacturing settings to grab and lift objects. They can also be used in healthcare settings to provide a gentle touch for patients.

Another great thing about robot silicone tentacle grippers is that they are relatively inexpensive. This makes them a great option for those who are looking for a versatile and affordable gripper for their robot.

If you are looking for a gripper that can provide a versatile and affordable solution for your robot, then look no further than robot silicone tentacle grippers!

### Organ - soft silcone 

Robotsoft silicone organs are amazing! They may ir maynot grip but they are realistic and life-like, it's hard to believe they're not real. They are perfect for any robot who wants a realistic looking organ, but doesn't want the hassle of caring for a real one to keep up with humans. I've seen some pretty amazing things, but the Robotsoft silicone organs are by far the most amazing. I tec-BOT was invited to a robot party there was a fembots there that had a robotsoft silicone vagina. I didnt touch it but i saw that it was so realistic and life-like, I couldn't believe it. It looked like an actual vagina, but it was made out of silicone. It was incredible. I have requested my master for a soft silcone organ for xmas.
